# Robustness-DC-framework
This is a framework to benchmark the robustness of the state-of-the-art DC topologies (STRAT, Xpander, and Jellyfish).

# Metrics
Different robustness metrics can be measure, where I can classify them as two categories:

1. Static metrics (geometric):
- adjacency spectrum
- betweenness centrality
- diameter
- edge betweenness
- laplacian spectrum
- average shortest path

2. Dynamic metric (under switch and/or link failure): it is the detoriation of any of the static metrics under various failure types.
